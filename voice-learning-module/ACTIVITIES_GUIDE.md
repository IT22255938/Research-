## 📊 Adaptive Difficulty Algorithm

All activities use the same adaptive difficulty system:

```
IF student_accuracy >= 0.75:
  difficulty += 1 (up to max)
ELSE IF student_accuracy < 0.50:
  difficulty -= 1 (down to min)
ELSE:
  difficulty = unchanged
```

**Purpose**: Keep students in "optimal challenge zone"
- Not too easy (boredom)
- Not too hard (frustration)
- Scaffolded learning progression

**Personalization**: Each student has independent difficulty level per activity
- Emma: Counting Adventure at Level 3
- Lucas: Number Recognition at Level 1
- Sophia: Math Mystery Solver at Level 2

---

## 🗣️ Voice Input Integration

All activities support voice recognition:

### Web Speech API Integration
- Students answer verbally
- Response processing (fuzzy matching)
- Support for multiple answer variations
- Confidence scoring

### Example Voice Responses
```
Q: "How many apples?"
Possible Voice Inputs:
✅ "one" → Correct
✅ "one apple" → Correct (fuzzy match)
✅ "1" → Correct (digit spoken)
❌ "two" → Incorrect
```

### Accent and Speech Variation
- Fuzzy matching handles pronunciation variations
- Accent-tolerant recognition
- Multiple acceptable answer formats
- Emotional support for misunderstandings
